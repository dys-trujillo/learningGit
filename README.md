Code created to learn about git

As a study roadmap:

git status: verify which files were changed

To register a change:

1. git add: add changes in order to commit

2. git commit: register changes in repo (use -m + "message" to include title)

3. git push: upload changes into repo

To update branches and repo:

1. git pull: download changes from others/changes made directly in github

To undo a git commit, but not git pushed:

1. git reset: if not uploaded to remote branch, it is recommended to delete. Otherwise, version change will be impacted and not recommended for group coding

To modify a commit:

1. git commit --amend -m "correct message"
