Code created to learn about git

As a study roadmap:

git status: verify which files were changed

To register a change:

1. git add: add changes in order to commit

2. git commit: register changes in repo (use -m + "message" to include title)

3. git push: upload changes into repo

To update branches and repo:

1. git pull: download changes from others/changes made directly in github
